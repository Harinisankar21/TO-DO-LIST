# TO-DO-LIST
The **To-Do List Application** is a simple, user-friendly tool built using only frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create and delete tasks as complete directly in the browser. Tasks are stored temporarily in the browser's local storage, enabling data persistence without a backend. The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring accessibility across devices. Users can organize their tasks by priority and easily track their progress in real-time. This project demonstrates the power of frontend development in creating functional and interactive web applications.
